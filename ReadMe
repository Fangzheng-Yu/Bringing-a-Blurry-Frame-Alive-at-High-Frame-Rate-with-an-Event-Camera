Bringing a Blurry Frame Alive at High Frame-Rate with an Event Camera 

Please run ‘./snowman codefortest/maindalta.m’, and man-
ually change the two slide bars to visualize the recon-
structed image. ‘Threshold c’ is the threshold to trigger an
event. ‘Frame t’ is the reconstructed image at timestamp t.
